  What are you intensely curious about? Following one's curiosity
  is the golden path to developing something impactful in the
  world. This is how the best startups start and where new
  inventions arise. Global progress is limited to the ambition of
  the most ambitious. If you're an ambitious person who has been
  itching to explore a space or project out of curiosity, Hacker
  Hub is for you.

  Have you always wanted to make a robotic chef? How about an AI
  that places you in Avengers or Inside Out? We meet up weekly to
  work on our ideas and give feedback. If you want to build a
  product and get users, awesome, we'll help. If you wish to
  explore Black Holes, that's equally as awesome. We'll bring in
  speakers, give tactical feedback on ideas, provide a space to
  demo your work and expose you to grants and funding
  opportunities. With more traction, we'll also provide hardware
  like arduinos and vr headsets.

  This club is not for everyone. It's for those who feel school is
  not enough for their ambition and want to be pushed to make
  great things. If you've felt tired of solely focusing on grades
  and feel you can do so much more outside of a classroom, come
  join us, you're a rare group of people.
